"""
This demo script shows how to send audio data to Audio2Face Streaming Audio Player via gRPC requests.
There are two options:
 * Send the whole track at once using PushAudioRequest()
 * Send the audio chunks seuqntially in a stream using PushAudioStreamRequest()
For the second option this script emulates the stream of chunks, generated by splitting an input WAV audio file.
But in a real application such stream of chunks may be aquired from some other streaming source:
 * streaming audio via internet, streaming Text-To-Speech, etc
gRPC protocol details could be find in audio2face.proto
